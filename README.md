This maze is based on the Virtual Maze Task (VMT) used by Wamsley et al. (2010, 2019) for the evaluation of dreams. The ultimate goal of this application is the replication of previous studies and to use this maze to evaluate other spatial learning and wayfinding features. This repository contains all project files along with the built application (for stability run on Unity v2021.1.14f1).

It's not fully developed yet, and comments in scripts are messy. This maze is currently under study in the form of a registered report submitted to PCI-RR. Click [here](https://osf.io/mctzn) for the manuscript for more information on the maze and the task.

## Features
- Desktop and VR versions (currently only Oculus devices)
- Optional (but suggested) blurring and vignette occlusion while moving to reduce cybersickness
- Trials and sessions are fixed to preserve the structure of the original experiments (may change it in the future)
- Log files with session data (completion time, distance, grid distance, grid backtracking), positions (for path reconstruction)
